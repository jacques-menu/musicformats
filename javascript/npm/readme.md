Welcome to the libmusicxml project
======================================================================


The MusicXML library is a library designed close to the MusicXML format and intended to facilitate MusicXML support.

[MusicXML](http://www.musicxml.com/) is a music interchange format designed for notation, analysis, retrieval, and performance applications. The MusicXML format has been initialy developed by Recordare. It is open for use by anyone under a royalty-free license.


The libmusicxml javascript library provides mainly high level functions to convert the MusicXML format to the [Guido Music Notation](http://guidodoc.grame.fr) format or to the [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) format.

This package is available from [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@grame/libmusicxml)
