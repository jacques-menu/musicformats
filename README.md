# MusicFormats library

The [MusicFormats library](https://github.com/jacques-menu/musicformats) is dedicated to the conversion of music score formats such as MusicXML, LilyPond, braille music and Guido.
It also contains generators of such formats, as well as a preliminary MSDL (Music Scores Description Language) compiler that generates them.

MusicFormats embeds a version of the [libmusicxml library](https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml.git), which supports the MusicXML format.
