# MusicFormats library

The [MusicFormats library](https://github.com/jacques-menu/musicformats) is dedicated to the conversion of music score formats such as MusicXML, LilyPond, braille music and Guido.
It also contains generators of such formats, as well as a preliminary MSDL (Music Scores Description Language) compiler that generates them.

There is also an interpreter for MFSL (MusicFormats Scripting Language) to ease the use of options with the tools provided by MusicFormats.

MusicFormats embeds a version of the [libmusicxml library](https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml.git), which supports the MusicXML format.
