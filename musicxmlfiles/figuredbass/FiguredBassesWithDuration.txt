Some features for figured bass mentioned in the [trunk] article still have not been implemented for MusicXML:

#3: Figures that change ‘mid-way’ needs to be handled with duration tags
#4: Extension/continuation lines should distinguish “start”, “continue”, and “stop” – useful because MuseScore displays each type differently
The figured bass entry in the MusicXML 3.0 documentation recommends the following (paraphrased):

Duration should be used when the figure is shorter than the note, e.g., when a figure changes ‘mid-way’
Extend should be used when there is an extension line
The current version (Beta 1.0, see below) does the following instead:

No support for duration information; figures that change ‘mid-way’ are lost
Extend when the figure is longer than the note; multiple figures with different-length continuation lines are not supported/possible
I should have a patch ready within the next couple weeks.

Version Number: MuseScore 2 Beta 1.0 (revision 1efc609)
Operating System: Mac OS X 10.9.5
