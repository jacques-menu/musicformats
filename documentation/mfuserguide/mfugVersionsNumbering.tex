\chapter{Versions numbering}\label{Versions numbering}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\mf\ uses \MainIt{semantic} version numbering, such as \code{0.9.61}:%%%JMI
\begin{itemize}
\item the library itself gets a new number right after a new branch as been created for it. Branching to "0.9.60" causes the library to be numbered "0.9.61" with \code{SetMusicFormatsVersionNumber.bash};

\item each representation, converter or pass that is modified this new branch has been created gets a new history element with the same number as the library.
\end{itemize}

Thus all the executable services have the same version number as the library, but their components may have older version numbers. This can be seen with options \optionNameBoth{mf-version}{mfv}, \optionNameBoth{version}{v} and \optionNameBoth{version-full}{vf} :
