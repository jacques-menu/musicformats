\chapter{The MusicFormats repository}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

The \mf\ repository contains several versions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \default \master\ version, to be found at \url{https://github.com/jacques-menu/musicformats}, is where changes are pushed by the maintainers of \mf. It is the most up to date;
\item the \code{v.\dots} versions are the \master\ versions \frozen\ at some point in time.
\end{itemize}

This document mentions sample files in various formats. They can be seen online on the \code{dev} version, whose name and URL never change, at \url{https://github.com/jacques-menu/musicformats/tree/dev/files}.

These examples are mentioned in this document as they appear in the \mf\ repository, in subdirectories of the \fileName{files} directory. Currently, there are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \fileName{musicxmlfiles} for \mxml\ files;
\item \fileName{msdlfiles} for \msdlLang\ files.
%\item \fileName{meifiles} for \meiLang\ files;
%\item \fileName{bmmlfiles} for \bmmlLang\ files;
%\item \fileName{midifiles} for \MIDI\ files.
\end{itemize}

A typical example is \gitmxmlfile{basic/HelloWorld.xml}, which stands for the following, with the \code{dev} cloned locally in the \fileName{musicformats-git-dev} directory:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Terminal]

\end{lstlisting}
