It may be useful for \mf\ users to have an insight of what is behind the scenes.
The picture at \figureRef{The MusicFormats score view}, shows how it views a music score, i.e. how it represents it in \msrRepr.

\subimport{../CommonLaTeXFiles}{MusicFormatsScoreViewPicture}

The background colors are used as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \colorbox{black}{\textcolor{green}{green}}: an element that is expected to be found in a score representation, such as \Main{Staff} and \Main{Chord};

\item \colorbox{black}{\textcolor{pink}{pink}}: a element needed internally in MSR to structure the representation, such as \Main{Segment} and \Main{Syllable}. Those are not known by musicians, and specific to \mf;

\item \colorbox{black}{\textcolor{yellow}{yellow}}: elements that can be used in other ones, such as a \Main{Voice} containing \Main{VoiceElement}s. Those are specific to \mf\ too.
\end{itemize}

The arrows colors have the following meaning:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{blue}{blue}: can be contained in. For example, an \Main{Tuplet} can be contained in a \Main{GraceNotesGroup}, which can be contained in (attached to) a \Main{Note}.

\item \textcolor{red}{red}: a particular case of. For example, \Main{Part} is a particular case of \Main{PartGroupElement}, and a \Main{PartGroup} is a particular case of \Main{PartGroupElement}, meaning that part groups can be \MainIt{nested}.
\end{itemize}

This view is inspired by both \mxml\ and \lily. The specific \mf\ specific aspects are there due to implementation considerations.
