Many thanks to \fober, the designer and maintainer of the \libmusicxml\ library, available at \url{https://github.com/grame-cncm/libmusicxml}. This author would not have attempted to work on a \mxml\ to LilyPond\ converter without his work being already available.

In particular, the conversion of \mxml\ data to a tree is extremely well done directly from the \mxml\ \dtd, and that was a necessary step to produce \lily\ code. Dominique also provided a nice way to browse this tree with a two-phase visitor design pattern, which this author uses extensively in his own code. The interested reader can find information about that in \gitdocpdf{presentation}{libmusicxml2.pdf}, and more technical details in \gitdocpdf{MusicFormatsMaintainanceGuide}{MusicFormatsMaintainanceGuide.pdf}.

\xmlToLy\ and some of the specific examples presented in this document started as this author's contribution to \libmusicxml, and was later moved to a separate GitHub repository for practical reasons.
