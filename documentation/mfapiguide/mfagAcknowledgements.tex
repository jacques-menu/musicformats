Many thanks to \fober, the designer and maintainer of the \libmusicxml\ library. This author would not have attempted to work on a \mxml\ to LilyPond\ converter without his work being already available.

In particular, the conversion of \mxml\ data to a tree is extremely well done directly from the \mxml\ \dtd, and that was a necessary step to produce \lily\ code. Dominique also provided a nice way to browse this tree with a two-phase visitor design pattern, which this author uses extensively in his own code. The interested reader can find information about that in \gitdocpdf{presentation}{libmusicxml2.pdf}, and more technical details in \gitdocpdf{mfmaintainanceguide}{mfmaintainanceguide.pdf}.

\xmlToLy\ and some of the specific examples presented in this document started as this author's contribution to \libmusicxml, and was later moved to a separate GitHub repository for practical reasons.
