\chapter{Part groups handling}\label{Part groups handling}
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\mf\ part groups are presented at \chapterRef{Part groups}.

In \mxml, part groups can overlap, even though no one seems ever to have needed that. That seems to be more a feature in the Finale handling of \mxml export that a true musical need.

\msrRepr\ does not support overlapping part group. Handling part groups is done in \mxsrToMsrBoth{mxsr2msrTranslator.h}, where overlapping groups are identified and rejected:

Class {\tt mxmlPartGroupDescr} contains:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=CPlusPlus]
struct mxmlPartGroupDescr : public smartable

/*
  positions represent the order in which the parts appear in <part-list />

Part groups numbers number re-used and they can be nested, so there is an implicit part group at the top of their hierachy, attached to the \class{msrScore}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=CPlusPlus]
class EXP mxsr2msrSkeletonBuilder :
	// ... ... ...

    // an implicit part group has to be created to contain everything,
    // since there can be parts out of any explicit part group
    S_mxmlPartGroupDescr      fImplicitPartGroupDescr;
    S_msrPartGroup            fImplicitPartGroup;

    void                      createImplicitPartGroup ();

    // part groups numbers can be re-used, they're no identifier
    // we use a map to access them by part group number
    int                       fPartGroupsCounter;
    vector<S_mxmlPartGroupDescr>
                              fPartGroupDescsVector;
    map<int, S_mxmlPartGroupDescr>
                              fAllPartGroupDescrsMap;
    map<int, S_mxmlPartGroupDescr>
                              fStartedPartGroupDescrsMap;

	// ... ... ...
